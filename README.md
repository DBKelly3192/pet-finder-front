# pet-finder-front

This repo is dedicated to the frontend of 'Pet Finder' App!

## Deployment

* **HEROKU** - https://pet-finder-front.herokuapp.com

## Approaches Taken

* Animations are utilized whenever a card is flipped
* All game cards are created dynamically for ease and for shock and awe
* All game logic is implemented through class methods
* setTimeout statements are utilized throughout to give the appearance of automation

## User Stories

1. Stanly
  * Ok, there are some cards face down on a blue background
  * The cards flip over when they are clicked on to reveal various images
  * That's about it

2. Tori 
  * Cards are still face down on a blue background
  * The cards flip over when they are clicked on to reveal various images
  * When I find a matching pair, they remain face-up
  * When I select a non-matching pair, the most recently selected card does not reveal itself
  * I matched all the cards and nothing happened

3. Bill **MVP**
