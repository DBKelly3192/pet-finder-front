# pet-finder-front

This repo is dedicated to the frontend of 'Pet Finder' app! This is the third project of our Software Engineering Immersive course. This was a group project that allowed us to get a feel for real-world, remote, collabrative programming.   

## Backend Repo

## Deployment

* **HEROKU** - https://pet-finder-front.herokuapp.com

## Approaches Taken

Our group decided to utilize React for the frontend with Python and Flask running our server on the backend. We decided on React for the frontend of our app because we wanted our app to be as smooth and seamless as possible for the user. We chose Python and Flask for our backend because of the simplicity of coding in Python and because of the speed of a SQL database.
